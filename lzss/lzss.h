/***************************************************************************
* LZSS encoding and decoding prototypes for functions with file pointer
* parameters.  Provide these functions with a pointer to the open binary
* file to be encoded/decoded (fpIn) and pointer to the open binary target
* file (fpOut).  It is the job of the function caller to open the files
* prior to callings these functions and to close the file after these
* functions have been called.
*
* These functions return 0 for success and -1 for failure.  errno will be
* set in the event of a failure.
